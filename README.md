##Why Markdown?
We used markdown in class to do our programming write ups. Its just a very elegant way to write up specs without spending time messing with word or whatever. Github auto-displays a readme in a folder. 

Ideally I'd like to use it to be organized about our shit. You and I are apparently the most professional and  tidy of both of our work teams, so by our powers combined, we can be awesome. Since we shouldn't work on the same scenes, we can use md files to document what were each doing and how to use our features.

A perfectly good and lightweight md editor is markdownpad. Its what i use (actually i use vim because command line). Use Mau if your on your mac.
